# About

This project is about a new Resource Type in Concourse CI for VMware's product named vRealize Automation (https://www.vmware.com/in/products/vrealize-automation.html)

With this Resource Type, any pipeline from Concourse will be able to trigger a pipeline in vRealize Automation, execute the required tasks, and bring the execution context/output back to Concourse.

More about Concourse Resource Types can be found at https://resource-types.concourse-ci.org/
